### Easy Extensions

#### Adding New Quizzes
The database seed script is structured for easy additions:
```typescript
await prisma.quiz.create({
  data: {
    categoryId: category.id,
    title: 'Your Quiz Title',
    description: 'Description here',
    difficulty: 'intermediate',
    questions: {
      create: [/* question objects */]
    }
  }
});
```

#### Adding New Categories
Simply add to the seed script:
```typescript
const newCategory = await prisma.quizCategory.create({
  data: {
    name: 'New Category',
    description: 'Description',
    icon: 'ðŸ“š',
  }
});
```

#### Custom Scoring Logic
Modify `server/src/controllers/attemptController.ts`:
```typescript
// Add weight-based scoring
// Add time-based bonuses
// Add streak multipliers
```
